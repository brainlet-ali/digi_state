## About DigiState

Invest in government verified real estate without flinching an eye.

## Inspiration

The recent boom in real estate market in Pakistan has made it a lucrative prospect for individuals to invest in this
sector and have returns on their investments fast and big. But not all the players in the sector believe in fair
playing. They trick their clients into marketing gimmicks to sell fake files and property for monetary gain. On top of
that government of Pakistan has no way of knowing exactly who sold/buy a property which causes tax evasion and loss to
the economy. The fraudulent practices in the sector also lowers the investment confidence resulting in degraded economic
activity.

## What it does

The proposed solution is very simple on investors' end. All they have to do is to scan a QR code to start investing in government verified real estate projects with confidence. The government will issue a QR code after verification for any project/unit/property which a real estate agent/developer requests for approval. The real estate developers then can use these QR codes in their marketing materials or on premises.



## How we built it

This project is at ideation stage. An API needs to be build to be consumed by dashboards and mobile apps. APIs/Backend will be built in Laravel (PHP), dashboards in React JS and mobile apps for Android/iOS in React Native. (see project media for data flow)



## What we learned

Qarib Kazmi and Hania Zia talks helped to bring more clarity and refinement to solution model/UI that is being presented.


## What's next for Digi State

To create an MVP of the solution and seek seed funding.
